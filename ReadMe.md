### TODO

- CMS Integration: Im not sure of the route I want to go at the moment. I probably will just build my own and tbh I think I wanna get rid of edgedb and just use sqlite. Its a simple blog and I dont see the purpose of it being tide to services. For building my own should I do a webgui or TUI is my delema. I've really enjoyed using bubble tea and at the end of the day i just need a way to up load and download data. With using md I just dont see the point of needing to integrate an editor.
